# [Ansible role owncloud](#ansible-role-owncloud)

Install and configure ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS) on your system.

ownCloud 'classic' (the PHP-based server this role used to install) hard-rejects
PHP 8.0+ and never will support it - a permanent vendor incompatibility that
pinned this role to end-of-life Debian 11 (the last release still shipping PHP
7.4). oCIS is ownCloud's PHP8-compatible successor: a single statically-linked
Go binary with no PHP, Apache, MySQL, or Redis dependency.

## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-owncloud/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  roles:
    - role: buluma.owncloud
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-owncloud/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Install sudo if missing
      ansible.builtin.raw: "{{ ansible_pkg_mgr | default('dnf') }} install -y sudo"
      become: false
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

    - name: Install python3 if missing
      ansible.builtin.raw: >-
        if [ -x /usr/bin/python3 ]; then exit 0; fi;
        if command -v apt-get >/dev/null 2>&1; then apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3;
        elif command -v dnf >/dev/null 2>&1; then dnf install -y python3;
        elif command -v yum >/dev/null 2>&1; then yum install -y python3;
        elif command -v zypper >/dev/null 2>&1; then zypper -n install python3;
        else exit 1; fi
      become: false
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

    - name: Configure passwordless sudo
      ansible.builtin.raw: >-
        if ! grep -q '^%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' /etc/sudoers; then
          echo '%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers;
        fi;
        visudo -cf /etc/sudoers
      become: false
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-owncloud/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
---
# ownCloud 'classic' (the PHP-based server this role used to install) hard-
# rejects PHP 8.0+ and never will support it - a permanent vendor
# incompatibility (see meta/preferences.yml history). ownCloud's PHP8-
# compatible successor is Infinite Scale (oCIS): a single Go binary, no
# PHP/Apache/MySQL/Redis involved. This role now installs that instead.

# oCIS release to install.
ocis_version: "8.2.0"

# Owner and group for oCIS.
ocis_owner: "ocis"
ocis_group: "ocis"

# Where the oCIS binary, config, and data live.
ocis_binary_path: "/usr/bin/ocis"
ocis_config_dir: "/etc/ocis"
ocis_data_path: "/var/lib/ocis"

# Public URL and bind address (see OCIS_URL / PROXY_HTTP_ADDR).
ocis_url: "https://{{ ansible_facts['default_ipv4'].address | default(ansible_facts['all_ipv4_addresses'][0]) }}:9200"
ocis_http_addr: "0.0.0.0:9200"

# This role doesn't manage TLS certificates, so oCIS falls back to its own
# auto-generated self-signed certificate out of the box - set false only
# once you've put a real certificate in front of it.
ocis_insecure: true

ocis_log_level: "error"

# Admin account. oCIS generates a random admin password on init unless
# IDM_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set - this role always sets it explicitly.
ocis_admin_pass: OwnCl0uD
```
